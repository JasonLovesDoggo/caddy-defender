## **Caddy Defender Plugin**

The **Caddy Defender** plugin is a middleware for Caddy that allows you to block or manipulate requests based on the client's IP address. It is particularly useful for preventing unwanted traffic or polluting AI training data by returning garbage responses.

---

## **Features**

- **IP Range Filtering**: Block or manipulate requests from specific IP ranges.
- **Embedded IP Ranges**: Predefined IP ranges for popular AI services (e.g., OpenAI, DeepSeek, GitHub Copilot).
- **Custom IP Ranges**: Add your own IP ranges via Caddyfile configuration.
- **Multiple Responder Backends**:
  - **Block**: Return a `403 Forbidden` response.
  - **Garbage**: Return garbage data to pollute AI training.
  - **Custom**: Return a custom message.

---

## **Installation**

### **Using Docker**

The easiest way to use the Caddy Defender plugin is by using the pre-built Docker image.

1. **Pull the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/jasonlovesdoggo/caddy-defender:latest
   ```

2. **Run the Container**:
   Use the following command to run the container with your `Caddyfile`:
   ```bash
   docker run -d \
     --name caddy \
     -v /path/to/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile \
     -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
     ghcr.io/jasonlovesdoggo/caddy-defender:latest
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/Caddyfile` with the path to your `Caddyfile`.

### **Using `xcaddy`**

You can also build Caddy with the Caddy Defender plugin using [`xcaddy`](https://github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy), a tool for building custom Caddy binaries.

1. **Install `xcaddy`**:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy/cmd/xcaddy@latest
   ```

2. **Build Caddy with the Plugin**:
   Run the following command to build Caddy with the Caddy Defender plugin:
   ```bash
   xcaddy build --with github.com/jasonlovesdoggo/caddy-defender
   ```

   This will produce a `caddy` binary in the current directory.

3. **Run Caddy**:
   Use the built binary to run Caddy with your configuration:
   ```bash
   ./caddy run --config Caddyfile
   ```

## **Configuration**

### **Caddyfile Syntax**

The `defender` directive is used to configure the Caddy Defender plugin. It has the following syntax:

```caddyfile
defender <responder> [responder_args...] {
    range <ip_ranges...>
}
```

- `<responder>`: The responder backend to use. Supported values are:
  - `block`: Returns a `403 Forbidden` response.
  - `garbage`: Returns garbage data to pollute AI training.
  - `custom`: Returns a custom message (requires `responder_args`).
- `[responder_args...]`: Additional arguments for the responder backend. For the `custom` responder, this is the custom message to return.
- `<ip_ranges...>`: A list of CIDR ranges or predefined range keys (e.g., `openai`, `localhost`) to match against the client's IP.

#### **Ordering the Middleware**
To ensure the `defender` middleware runs before other middleware (e.g., `basicauth`), add the following to your global configuration:

```caddyfile
{
    order defender before basicauth
}
```

---

### **Examples**

#### **Block Requests**
Block requests from specific IP ranges:
```caddyfile
localhost:8080 {
    defender block {
        range 203.0.113.0/24 openai 198.51.100.0/24 
    } 
    respond "Hello, world!" # what humans see
}
```

#### **Return Garbage Data**
Return garbage data for requests from specific IP ranges:
```caddyfile
localhost:8081 {
    defender garbage {
        range 192.168.0.0/24 
    }
    respond "Hello, world!" # what humans see
}
```

#### **Custom Response**
Return a custom message for requests from specific IP ranges:
```caddyfile
localhost:8082 {
    defender custom "Custom response message" {
        range 10.0.0.0/8
    } 
    respond "Hello, world!" # what humans see
} 
```

## **Embedded IP Ranges**

The plugin includes predefined IP ranges for popular AI services. These ranges are embedded in the binary and can be used without additional configuration.

| Service             | IP Ranges                                    |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| OpenAI              | [openai.go](ranges/fetchers/openai.go)       |
| DeepSeek            | [deepseek.go](ranges/fetchers/deepseek.go)   |
| GitHub Copilot      | [github.go](ranges/fetchers/github.go)       |
| Microsoft Azure     | [azure.go](ranges/fetchers/azure.go)         |
| Localhost (testing) | [localhost.go](ranges/fetchers/localhost.go) |

More are welcome! for a precompiled list, see the [embedded results](ranges/data/generated.go)

## **Contributing**

We welcome contributions! Here’s how you can get started:

### Adding New IP Ranges
To add new IP ranges, you need to create a new fetcher in the `ranges/fetchers` package. Follow the steps in the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Adding a New Responder

To add a new responder, you need to create a new responder in the `responders` package and update the `UnmarshalCaddyfile` method in the `DefenderMiddleware` struct to handle the new responder. Follow the steps in the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
